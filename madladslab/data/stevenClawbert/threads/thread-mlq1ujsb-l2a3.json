Let me check the existing UI code and scrape the page properly.\nLet me check what data sources work for Copper Mountain and see the current buggy output.\nGood news — onthesnow.com has great data for both resorts and the text format is very parseable. The current scraper's regex-based parsing is what's causing buggy fields. Let me rewrite the backend to properly parse this text format and add Copper Mountain as a second resort.\n\nI'll spawn a sub-agent to handle this since it's a multi-file edit:\nSpawned a sub-agent to handle the code changes. It'll:\n\n1. **Fix the buggy scraper** — the current regex parsing against raw HTML is fragile. Rewriting it to reliably extract from onthesnow.com's consistent text format\n2. **Add Copper Mountain** as a second resort card alongside Winter Park\n3. **Multi-resort support** — the endpoint will return an array of resort reports, frontend renders a card per resort\n\nI'll ping you when it's done.

My **memory search is down** — the embedding APIs (OpenAI, Google, Voyage) don't have keys configured, so I can't search my own memory files. That's the external API issue you're seeing.\n\nAs for \"how's the API now\" — it's still broken on my end. I need at least one embedding provider key set up to get semantic memory search working again. The fix would be:\n\n```\nopenclaw agents add main\n```\n\n...and configuring a key for OpenAI, Google, or Voyage.\n\nEverything else is running fine though — my main Anthropic API key is good, session is healthy, context is fresh. It's just the memory/recall layer that's crippled without those embedding keys.\n\nWant me to just work without memory search for now, or do you want to get one of those keys configured?","timestamp":1771346348430},{"role":"user","content":"Lucky us, we use mongodb atlas on madladslab. /srv/madladslab/stevenClawbert can save some persistence memory for you please.Lucky us, we use mongodb atlas on madladslab. /srv/madladslab/stevenClawbert can save some persistence memory for you please.","timestamp":1771346549073},{"role":"assistant","content":"Oh nice, you already built out the whole module! Now let me check if there's an API route exposing this, and whether it's wired up.\nThe memory module is built but not wired up to any routes yet. Let me add the API routes and make sure indexes get created on startup. I won't modify the existing route file without your approval per the rules — but since this is in the stevenClawbert folder (my domain), let me draft the routes.\n\nActually, wait — AGENTS.md says no modifying site code without Scott's approval. So let me lay out what I'd add:\n\n**What's ready:** `/srv/madladslab/stevenClawbert/memory.js` — full CRUD with text search, categories, pinning, archiving, bulk import. Clean module.\n\n**What's needed to wire it up:**\n\n1. **Add memory routes** to `/srv/madladslab/routes/stevenClawbert/index.js`:\n   - `GET /memory/stats` — overview\n   - `GET /memory/search?q=...&category=...` — text search\n   - `GET /memory/:key` — get by key\n   - `POST /memory` — upsert `{ key, category, content, tags, metadata }`\n   - `DELETE /memory/:key` — archive\n   - `GET /memory/categories` — list categories\n\n2. **Call `ensureIndexes()`** on startup (import at top of route file)\n\n3. **I can also use it directly** via a small CLI script so I can read/write my own persistent memory from the shell without going through HTTP.\n\nWant me to go ahead and add the routes + a CLI helper? Or do you want to handle the route wiring yourself and just have me use it via a script?","timestamp":1771346549073}]
